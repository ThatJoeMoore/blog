I've been wanting to have a programming blog for a while. I've had fits and starts, but I always get bogged down in starting
to write my own site engine. In my mind, it's not enough to just throw something up on Blogspot; I've got to code it myself.
I'm a developer, right? Developing is what I do!

However, writing a blogging engine is Hard. I mean, I can mix a markdown parser and some JS and stick it all on Github, but
it eventually penetrated my brain that *someone already solved this problem*.  Okay, so, if I don't want to write everything
from scratch, let's throw a static site generator at the problem! All I need to do now is create my own, awesome, completely
custom theme using all of the latest CSS tricks I've discovered. Oooh, I've got a really good idea for a site that looks and
feels like an IDE. That'd be super cool!

But making things look good is Hard, as I've learned by sitting through endless design meetings debating the finer points of
which font and color combinations are most universally unoffensive (since, it seems, Newton's Third Law applies as much to 
design opinions as it does to physical forces).

I've been trying lately to work in a more minimalistic way, repeating to myself that You Ain't Gonna Need It. I've been trying
to separate what's important from what's just something that needs to be done, and while things in the second category still
need to get done, they might not warrant as much time as things in the other group. So what's important about a blog? Is it 
the look, or the underlying code? No, it's the *content*. So, here I am, using [Somebody Else's Code](https://gohugo.io) to 
generate a site that uses [Somebody Else's Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/kiss/). Sure, I'll probably get around to
customizing the styling at some point, and perhaps even tinker with the underlying generator, but I can live with these ones.

For now, it's okay to be boring, because at least I'm getting stuff done. And by getting stuff done, I mean, of course, rambling
about boring things and proffering unsolicited opinions, since that's what I *really* want to do anyway.
